This was extremely GREAT, the way we can route urls with react-router-dom just amazed me, super fun to do, I can't wait to learn even more.🎉🎉🎉

Always great to use JSON Server to test the request but of course with the limitation that can't test the methods on the live demo, but ir works like charm!
